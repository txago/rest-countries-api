# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher

I took this challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) to practice my **React** and **Javascript** skills.

## The challenge

I should integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like the images provided inside the designs folder. For this purpose, I chose **React** and played around with **React Hooks**, **Fetch API** and **styled-components**. I also had to style and think about interaction behaviors with nearly no design specs, only fonts and colors.
